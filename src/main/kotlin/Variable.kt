// There are two types of variable in kotlin [ var and val ]
// There is a difference between this both that val will store a constant value and var will store a normal value

//Example of VAR keyword
fun main() {
    var number = 10
    println("Number is : $number")
    number = 20
    println(number)
}

// Example of VAL keyword
//fun main() {
//    val number = 10
//    println(number)
//    number = 19 // This will not allow us to change the value
//}
